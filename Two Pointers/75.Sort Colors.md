## Sort Colors
**Medium**

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Could you solve this problem without using the library's sort function?
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only O(1) constant space?


```Java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int k = nums.length-1;
        while(j<=k){
            if(nums[j] == 0){ // compare j rather i
                swap(nums,i,j);
                j++;
                i++;
            }else if(nums[j] ==1 ){
                j++;
            }else {
                swap(nums,j,k);
                k--; // no k++;

            }
        }
    }
    private void swap(int[] arr, int x, int y) {
        int temp = arr[x];
        arr[x] = arr[y];
        arr[y] =temp;
    }
}

```

### Key points:
This is the typical rainbow sort algorithms
+ It's of vital importance to make clear the physical meaning of the indexes inside:
  we have i,j,k, and they represent:
  - [0,i) red color 0
  - [i,j) white color 1
  - [j,k] unsorted elements
  - (k,array.length-1] blue color 2
+   After being clear with the rules, it is easier to explain some operations inside. For instance, why we need j++and i++, and why the j++ is not needed in the last else sentence....
