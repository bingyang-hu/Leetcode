## Reverse String
**Easy**

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example:

> Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
> Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


``` Java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length-1;
        while(left <=right){
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }

    }
}
```

### Key Points:
+ High level: two pointers points to the both end of the array, and swap the values, then move towards the center together. The length of array (odd or even) does not matter.

+ Since s is an array of char, the temp should also be the type of char. Do not just get used to int value!
