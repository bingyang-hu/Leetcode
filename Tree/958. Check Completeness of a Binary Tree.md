Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

```Java

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {

        // Write your solution here
    if(root == null){
      return true;
    }
    Queue <TreeNode> q1 = new ArrayDeque<TreeNode> ();
    q1.offer(root);
    boolean flag = false;
    while(!q1.isEmpty() && flag == false) { //取反得到的：当q为空或者flag==true时，就停止循环
      int size = q1.size();
      for (int i = 0 ; i< size; i++){
        TreeNode newNode = q1.poll();
        if(newNode.left == null && newNode.right != null){
          return false;
        }else if (newNode.left == null || newNode.right == null){
          if(newNode.left != null){
            q1.offer(newNode.left);
          }
          if(newNode.right != null){
            q1.offer(newNode.right);
             }
             flag = true; // as long as one child node is null, set the flag to be true;
             break; // flag cannot be written inside the if because it is possible that both child nodes are null
        } else{ // break means that jump out of the for loop. Since flag becomes true, the while loop also stops.
          q1.offer(newNode.left);
          q1.offer(newNode.right);
        }
      }
    }
    // while loop end when q1 is vacent or flag is true now
    if(flag == true){
      while(!q1.isEmpty()){
        int size = q1.size();
        for(int i = 0;i<size; i++){
          TreeNode newNode1= q1.poll();
          if(newNode1.left != null || newNode1.right != null){
            return false;
          }

        }
      }
    }

    return true;

    }
}

```
Key Points:

+ Set a boolean value flag and the default value should be false. When a null child node appears, make it true. If any of the following nodes is not null, then return false.

+ Line 34: When we decide the while condition loop, we always think about when the stop condition, then negate the condition to make it be the loop condition. In this problem, we should stop the loop either then the queue is empty or the flag is true, so stop condition is:
  q1.isEmpty() || flag == true
  Based on **De Morgan's Law** we can negate it and get the loop condition: !q1.isEmpty() && flag == false

+ Line 38: if for a certain node, the left child is null while the right child is not null, then this tree is absolutely not complete tree.

+ Line 40: if (newNode.left == null || newNode.right == null) means 2 cases:
  + left node is not null while right node is null. Then we should set flag true and break the loop.
  + both left node and right node are null, thenwe should set flag and break the loop.
  + The 3rd is impossible because it should belong to the previous if condition. Line 38.

+ Line 47 and 48 cannot be included inside the previous if condition.
