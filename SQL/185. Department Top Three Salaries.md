**Hard**

```MSSQL
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT D.NAME AS Department, T.Name AS Employee, T.Salary AS Salary
FROM
    (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER By SALARY DESC) AS SalaryRank
    FROM Employee
    ) AS T
JOIN Department D on T.DepartmentId = D.Id
WHERE T.SalaryRank <= 3;
```


+ Create a subquery and remember to set alias T
+ Use WINDOW FUNCTION DENSE_RANK(), and the rank is decided by 'ORDER BY' section
