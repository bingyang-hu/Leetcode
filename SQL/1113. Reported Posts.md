**Easy**

```SQL
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT extra as report_reason, count(distinct(post_id)) as report_count
FROM Actions
WHERE extra IS NOT null AND  action_date='2019-07-04' AND action = 'report'
GROUP BY extra


-- -- // 1. no need for 'extra is not null'
-- 2. how to diff(today, -1)??

```
